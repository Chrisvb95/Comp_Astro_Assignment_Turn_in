# Comp_Astro_Assignment_3
Directory containing the files that were turned in for the first assignment. 

The write-up is found in the PDF named 'Computational_Astrophysics_Assignment_3.pdf'. The text file containing the code for the final simulation is found in 'q4_disk_planet_pStar.py'. We also added the movie of our final simulation because we were quite happy with the way that it turned out and thought that you would also like to see it.
