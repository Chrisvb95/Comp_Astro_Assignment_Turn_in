# Computational Astrophysics final project
Directory containing the files that were turned in for the final project.

The write-up is found in the PDF named 'Computational_Astrophysics_Final_Project.pdf'. The text file containing the code for the final simulation is found in 'cloud_cluster_with_full_sph.py'. For each of the experiments that we ran we also made separate directories containing the code (addapted to the experiment), the results and a video of the simulation.
