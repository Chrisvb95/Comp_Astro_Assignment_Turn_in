Directory containing the files that were turned in for the first assignment. 

The write-up is found in the PDF named \textit{Computational\_Astrophysics\_Assignment\_1.pdf}. The text file containing the code is found in \texttt{3\_body\_braid\_final.py}. Finally we also added the figures found in the text (and a few more) in the other directories.
